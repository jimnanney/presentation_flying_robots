TITLE: Friendly Flying Robots with Ruby

ABSTRACT:

We use Ruby in our Web applications. We use Ruby in our scripting. We
even use Ruby in our mobile phone applications these days. But here's
something new: Using Ruby to control flying robots.

The Parrot AR Drone is a consumer grade quadcopter designed to be
controlled from your smartphone over a WiFi signal. However, the
network protocols for controlling the drone are open and published in
the AR Drone SDK, so what is more natural than using our favorite
programming language to communicate and control these fun devices.

This talk will cover the nature of the AR Drone protocol and the
details of getting a Ruby program to communicate to and control the
drone. We will talk about the challenges of remote controlling flying
objects. And if all goes well, we will actually demonstrate all of the
above.

After all, admit it.  When robots finally take over the world,
wouldn't you prefer that they are programming in a friendly
programming language like Ruby?
